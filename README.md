# ðŸŽ® Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is a simple **two-player console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** implemented in Python. Players take turns choosing positions on a 3x3 board, and the game automatically detects wins or ties. The board updates after every move, and invalid inputs are handled gracefully.

## ðŸ›  Features

* Two-player gameplay in the terminal.
* Input validation (only accepts numbers 1â€“9 and unoccupied positions).
* Automatic win and tie detection.
* Real-time board updates after each move.

## ðŸ“‚ How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Save the script as `tic_tac_toe.py`.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt in the scriptâ€™s folder.
4. Run:

   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Gameplay Rules

* **Player 1** uses `X`
* **Player 2** uses `O`
* Players choose a position (1â€“9) to place their sign.
* First player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
* If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
